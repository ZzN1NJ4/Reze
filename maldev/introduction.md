Developing a Malware is a very simple task. But to do so while avoiding all the AVs, Defender, EDRs, Unga Bunga shit is sophisticated. Here I will discuss about different methods that I have read online / found in the wild.

Before all of that, there are some prerequisites inorder to get into it like :-

* Basic Computer Knowledge
* Low level Programming language like C/C++/Rust
* Basic Reversing
* Basic Assembly Instructions
* A lot of Determination & Patience

Complexity would gradually increase as we dive into windows internals to understand how certain things work. I have already mentioned the resources which I have found quite useful [here](https://github.com/ZzN1NJ4/Malware-Development/blob/main/RESOURCES.md), and I don't want to repeat the same thing again so go check that out if you want.

There would also be a lot of Googling stuffs & going through different Documentations & undocumented structures, etc.
