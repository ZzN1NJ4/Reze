## How it went

Okay I have mixed feelings for this CTF since there were some "fixes" and downtimes, but all in all, It was a fun experience. I couldn't do much on the first day (It started on Friday 5:30 pm IST -\_-), but on the 2nd day, they included some more challenges and I did the most at that time. Here are the writeups of all the challenges I did and I'll also try covering the ones I didn't do and some of them were really absurd like ???? (I'm looking at you `insanity check - OSINT`) . &#x20;
