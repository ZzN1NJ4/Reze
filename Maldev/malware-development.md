Developing a Malware is a very simple task. But to do so while avoiding all the AVs, Defender, EDRs, Unga Bunga shit is sophisticated. Here I will discuss about different methods that I have read online / found in the wild.

Before all of that, there are some prerequisites inorder to get into it like :-&#x20;

* Basic Computer Knowledge
* Low level Programming language like C/C++/Rust
* Basic Reversing
* Basic Assembly Instructions

Which would gradually increase as we dive into windows internals to understand how certains things work. I have already mentioned the resources required for it [here](https://github.com/ZzN1NJ4/Malware-Development/blob/main/RESOURCES.md), and I don't want to repeat the same thing again so go check that out.
