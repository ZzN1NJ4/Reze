Developing malware is one thing, but evading AVs, Defender, EDRs, and all the other security mechanisms is an entirely different challenge. Here, I'll break down various techniques I've come acrossâ€”whether from online sources, real-world samples, or my own (ridiculous) experiments.

Before all of that, there are some prerequisites in order to get into it like :-

* Basic Computer Knowledge
* Low level Programming language like C/C++/Rust
* Basic Reversing
* Basic Assembly Instructions
* Debugging
* A lot of Determination & Patience

Complexity would gradually increase as we dive into windows internals to understand how certain things work. I have already mentioned the resources which I have found quite useful [here](https://github.com/ZzN1NJ4/Malware-Development/blob/main/RESOURCES.md), and I don't want to repeat the same thing again so go check that out if you want.

There would also be a lot of Googling stuffs & going through different Documentations & undocumented structures, and smashing your head against the wall. Perseverance is necessary
