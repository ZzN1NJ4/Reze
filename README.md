# About Me

### About Me (but small)

Hi, I am Reze / ZzN1NJ4.

I like studying / practicing (ethical)hacking. Currently I am learning about Malware Development & Reverse Engineering. I generally love low level stuffs. I also like spending my time solving CTF challenges like [HTB](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/778904) / [THM](https://tryhackme.com/p/ZzN1NJ4) etc.

I know languages like C/C++/Python/Javascript and still learning Rust :crab:, simply because I love Rust very much afljweoigldfkjaow. I also love playing games like [Chess](https://www.chess.com/member/n1nj4\_629), [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/user/63330977a312727be9e4b64b), and some other random games.

### What is this Blog about?

This blog is a dedicated space where I share my knowledge and discoveries which I have learned/found throughout my evergoing journey of learning Malwares / (R.E.) Low level stuffs & Other Read Teaming Notes. My aim is to provide knowledge about the stuff that I learn and simply just make notes out of it for future references. I’ll try my best to make things more understandable (I am dumb).

It is also helps me with having an easy way to access my notes which I can refer whenever I require without even the need to be on my pc. I hope you find these notes helpful.

There would also be some  Reverse Engineering, Binary exploitation, random cool methods / challenges, and also other weird things that I would like to share as well.\
